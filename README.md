Hi.  This is a model of what can happen to electricity infrastructure over time under various scenarios.
It starts from a recent copy of the EIA's US hourly electricity production.  We look at the last 4 years.
The data is per source (Solar, Wind, Nuclear, Natural Gas, etc.) and divided into 13 regions.
It then finds the optimum (lowest cost) mix of energy from each source to meet hourly demand.
The results are displayed in an Excel spreadsheet.
The key variables are growth in demand, and the cost of CO2eq.
Modifications to the price, build rate, and lifetime for each energy source, interest rate for capital, etc. can also be modeled.
The goal is to find the best way to reduce carbon emissions.
